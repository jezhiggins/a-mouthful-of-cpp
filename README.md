# A Mouthful of C++

Are you C++ curious?

This participatory session will give you a taste of C++. We'll write some
small programs, kick around some ideas, have some conversations, with
the aim of getting a bit of a feel for the language - what it looks
like, how it differs from or is similar to the languages you already
know, and maybe even how some of it works.

We'll try to tour round the major features of the language, but we will,
of necessity, have to go at a bit of a lick so it'll be something of a
whistle-stop tour. What we won't be doing though is dwelling on the
history, engaging in diatribes about why such-and-such is better than
so-and-so, and we'll try and avoid esoterica. I hope it'll be fun, if
slightly frantic.

You? You should be familiar with another language - JavaScript, Python,
Java, C#, or pretty much anything else. Please bring a laptop<sup>+</sup>, 
your typing fingers, and maybe some questions.

Me? I'm Jez Higgins, a jobbing programmer who has had an on-again
off-again relationship with C++ for over 25 years. I'll try to bring
some answers.

<sup>+</sup> Ideally, you'll have either [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
 or [Visual Studio Code (with the
C/C++ and CMake Tools extensions)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) 
installed beforehand. CLion has a 30 day trial license, while Visual Studio Code is free. 
Don't worry if not, just arrive a few minutes early and I'll try to sort you out. If you're a 'vi'/emacs/Sublime/anything-else user, that's fine too - but you will need a C++ compiler and CMake installed on your system. In general, if you're on a Unix-like system you probably do, and if you're on Windows you probably don't.
