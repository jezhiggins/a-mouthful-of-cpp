{cpp} is not garbage collected

OK with this?

Those of you old enough to remember when Java was launched - maybe none of you - might recall that one of Java's big selling points was "it was simpler than {cpp}", and one of the reasons given for that was "it was garbage collected".

Need to create a bunch of objects? Well, just create those bad boys. It'll be fine. The GC will come through later on and tidy everything up for you.

When we create objects in {cpp}, we know when those objects are going to die. (*Mostly.)
