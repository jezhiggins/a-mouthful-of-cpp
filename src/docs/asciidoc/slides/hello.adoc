Hello everyone. I'm Jez and this is a mouthful of {cpp}.

Often, when people start a talk or whatever, they open with a little bit to qualify why they're there and from what authority they speak. You know the kind of thing - I work for so-and-so in the such-and-such team, here's a book I wrote about this very topic, or whatever. Now, I understand entirely why people do that, but I kind of shy away from that myself. I don't know about you, but I'm always a little bit wary of people who describe themselves as experts, even if I know that to be the case. While I think it is important to give a little bit of context about who you are, my default mode is more of an anti-qualification. So, my name's Jez and, as you can see, the grey-progression in my beard is well over half-way. I've been programming a long time, and I've worked on a lot of different things. My particular qualification for being here today is that Paul Grenyer asked me ("I've tried all the actual experts and they said no") and, when I was inclined to decline, Dom Davis persuaded me.

I'm a decent hand at {cpp}, and I'm assuming you all are not? Great if you are. I'm also a fair-to-middling hand at most of the other mainstream languages too, and hopefully you are too. You all know your way around a programming language or two or three or N?

Having listened to that introductory blurb, if anyone is now thinking "OMG I am in completely the wrong talk", it's entirely fine if you want to flee the room and go to one of the other sessions. Equally, if we get part way through and you've had enough, I will not be the slightest bit put out if you want to duck out. There's a lot going on this afternoon, and I'd hate anyone to be sitting here out of politeness or shyness or embarrassment. If you'd like to stay though, that's lovely.

We're scheduled here this afternoon for just over two hours, which is simultaneously quite a long time and not very long at all. There isn't a hope in hell we can touch all the parts of {cpp}, or any language for that matter, but we can hopefully at least have a glance at enough to get you going.

So, shall we crack on?
