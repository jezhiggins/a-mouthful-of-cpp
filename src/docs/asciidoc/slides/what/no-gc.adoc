No, really, don't panic.

This is the first time I have ever used a Don't Panic slide, or had an overt Hitchhikers reference, and I do kind of feel bad about that, but really don't panic.

It's cool.

Hopefully, as we get into some code, you won't even notice that it's an issue.

Speaking of code, shall we look at some?  Some proper code?
